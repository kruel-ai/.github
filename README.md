**The first Agent Memory System.**

---

## What we're building

kruel.ai is building AI that **remembers**—with recall of conversations, documents, and code in full context, not just summaries. We focus on **advanced memory architecture**: multi-dimensional memory that preserves context across interactions, **entity intelligence** that keeps people and concepts straight over time, and **cross-domain intelligence** that links conversation, documents, and code in one unified view.

We're building the **memory and cognitive backbone** for agentic AI: so assistants and systems can have continuous context, understand not only what you say but how you feel about it, and adapt accordingly—with **privacy-first** design and user control over data and connectivity.

Our public site at [kruel.ai](https://kruel.ai) describes our advanced system and its capabilities (multimodal understanding, intelligent orchestration, voice, research, creative AI). Implementation details stay private; this repo is part of that ecosystem.

K9 and KX are **research systems**—different approaches to the same goal (agent memory, orchestration, context). They explore alternative architectures and workflows; the public site reflects our production system.
